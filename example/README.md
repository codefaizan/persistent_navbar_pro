A versatile Flutter bottom navigation bar that supports both named routes and direct widget-based navigation.
This package allows you to create a persistent bottom navigation bar where each tab maintains its own
navigation stack. It works seamlessly with or without named routes, giving developers the freedom to
choose the navigation method that best fits their project.

Key Features:
- Persistent bottom navigation bar with independent navigation stacks for each tab.
- Works with both named routes and direct screen widgets.
- Uses `IndexedStack` to maintain the state of each screen while switching tabs.
- Flexible and easy to integrate into new or existing projects.
- Customizable icons and navigation logic per tab.
